    <string name="tutorial_1_content">Welcome to TODO list app!\n\nHere you can create your own lists so you won\'t forget to buy anything from the store, or to take equipment to a trip.\n\nOn the main screen all your lists appears in minimize mode. Pressing on the little triangle will expand the list and show it all. (On the settings screen you can change the settings of the minimize mode to your favorite size).</string>
    <string name="tutorial_2_content">To add a new list just tap on the big, gray \'plus\' button at the bottom of the screen. To see existing list, click on it, and it\'ll enter editing mode, where you can change the background color (upper right on the screen to show/hide coloring menu), and of course add new items to the list, and updating, deleting or mark as \'done\' existing items.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_3_content">At the beginning the title of the list will be in focus, but one click on \'enter\' will move the cursor to \'add new item\' line.  Note: each item can hold only one line. So if \'enter\' was pressed - new item will be added, or the next item will be in the updating line.</string>
